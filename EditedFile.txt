Objective: This study tested whether the quality of the patient-rated working alliance, measured early in
treatment, predicted subsequent symptom reduction in chronically depressed patients. Secondarily, the study
assessed whether the relationship between early alliance and response to treatment differed between patients
receiving cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy vs. brief supportive psychotherapy
 Method: 395 adults who met criteria for chronic depression
and did not fully remit during a 12-week algorithm-based, open-label pharmacotherapy trial were randomized
to receive either 16?20 sessions of CBASP or BSP in addition to continued, algorithm-based antidepressant
medication. Of these, 224 patients completed the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form at Weeks 2 or 4 of
treatment. Blind raters assessed depressive symptoms at 2-week intervals across treatment using the Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression. Linear mixed models tested the association between early alliance and subse-
quent symptom ratings while accounting for early symptom change. Results: A more positive early working
alliance was associated with lower subsequent symptom ratings in both the CBASP and BSP, F
62.48, p  .001. In addition, the interaction between alliance and psychotherapy type was significant, such that
alliance quality was more strongly associated with symptom ratings among those in the CBASP treatment
group, F 8.31, p  .004. Conclusions: The results support the role of the therapeutic alliance as
a predictor of outcome across dissimilar treatments for chronic depression. Contrary to expectations, the
therapeutic alliance was more strongly related to outcome in CBASP, the more directive of the 2 therapies.

alliance?outcome association limit the conclusions that can be
drawn.
A key issue is the direction of the alliance?outcome link. A
significant association between alliance and treatment outcome
may arise because the experience of a good therapeutic alliance
generates symptom change, because symptom change positively
influences one?s perception of the alliance, or because the two
variables mutually influence one another  As Feeley, DeRubeis, and
Gelfand noted, existing studies on the alliance?outcome
relationship have generally been observational rather than exper-
imental. Observational studies allow inference of causal implica-
tions only if certain conditions are met, a crucial one being
temporal precedence between the process and out-
come variables  To support the hypothesis that a good
therapeutic alliance mediates therapy outcome, the alliance must
be shown to predict outcome at a subsequent time point, while
accounting for change on the outcome variable prior to alliance
measurement 
Few studies meet these criteria  Reports on the
relationship between the alliance and outcome have been limited
by Correlating the alliance assessed at time point A with
subsequent outcome at posttreatment without accounting for the
possibility that some of the predicted change had already occurred
prior to time point A and correlating improvement in the
outcome variable from pre- to posttreatment with an average of
alliance scores across the course of treatment 
Among the relatively small number of studies that have inves-
tigated the temporal nature of the association between alliance and
outcome in patients with depression, results are inconsistent. We
are aware of three studies in which researchers have examined
whether alliance predicts subsequent outcome without controlling
for change in symptoms prior to the alliance assessment; none of
these demonstrated a significant alliance?outcome link. DeRubeis
and Feeley reported that alliance at Treatment Week 2 did
not predict subsequent residual change in depression severity in a
small sample of 25 patients diagnosed with major depressive
disorder who received cognitive therapy  Interest-
ingly, researchers of this study found the converse, that prior
change in depressive symptoms predicted quality of the alliance
measured during Treatment Weeks 7?9 and 10?12. In another
small study of 25 patients with MDD receiving CT, Feeley et al.
again found that Week 2 alliance did not predict subsequent
symptom change; this report did not replicate the earlier converse
finding that symptom change predicted later alliance  A study of 60 patients with MDD treated with CT
examined the association between repeated measures of the alli-
ance and session-to-session symptom improvement across the first
five sessions of treatment 
The alliance did not predict intersession reductions in symptoms,
but prior symptom change did predict subsequent alliance strength
 These investigators did not examine outcome
beyond 5 weeks.
Four studies conducted with depressed patients examined
whether alliance predicts subsequent outcome, while also control-
ling for change in outcome prior to measuring the alliance. This
reflects the most stringent test of the temporal associations be-
tween alliance and symptom change. In a study of 54 elderly
patients with MDD who received either brief dynamic therapy,
behavior therapy, or CT, Gaston, Marmar, Gallagher, and Thomp-
son reported that the relationship between alliance and
outcome across all three treatments was not significant. Three
other studies found that alliance quality predicted subsequent
change in symptoms when accounting for symptom change prior
to alliance assessment. In a study involving 367 chronically de-
pressed patients treated with either cognitive behavioral analysis
system of psychotherapy or CBASP plus medication, the
alliance significantly predicted subsequent change in depressive
symptoms while controlling for prior symptom change and other
patient characteristics with the potential to influence the alliance
 neither early level of symptoms nor early
change in symptoms predicted the subsequent level or course of
the alliance. In a study of 45 patients with MDD treated with an
alliance-enhancing therapy  after
controlling for early change in symptoms, early alliance predicted
change in depression scores from baseline to end of treatment
 These investigators also measured alliance later in treat-
ment and found that an average of alliance assessments conducted
at Sessions 3?9 had an even stronger relationship with outcome
than the early alliance  though this
association did not control for previous symptom change. Finally,
Webb and colleagues examined the alliance in 105 de-
pressed patients treated with CT in two separate randomized
controlled trials. An observer-rated version of early alliance was
used and was found to significantly predict outcome.
The inconsistent findings of studies that have reported on the
relation between alliance and subsequent symptom change may be related to 
the model of psychotherapy used and failure to examine
specific dimensions of the alliance. Although the data are mixed
 theory suggests that the alliance is
composed of different components, specifically tasks, goals, and
the therapist?patient emotional bond  Different
psychotherapy models may evoke different alliance types, ex-
pressed through different scoring patterns on alliance dimensions
 Webb et al. reported that
symptom change in patients who received CT was related to an
alliance factor assessing agreement on goals and tasks, but not to
the therapist?patient bond factor.
All but one of the previously cited studies involved only a single
treatment, precluding comparison of alliance effects across treat-
ments. In the one study that involved more than one psychotherapy
model, the sample size was too small to adequately examine
potential differences  Thus, no studies exam-
ining the alliance?outcome relationship in depressed patients have
reported on between-treatment differences in dimensions of the
alliance.
In the current study, we examined the relationship between early
alliance and subsequent change in depressive symptoms in two
distinct psychotherapies, namely CBASP or brief supportive psy-
chotherapy  while accounting for prior symptom change in
a single-patient population, consisting of chronically depressed
patients. Chronically depressed patients may present unique diffi-
culties in developing and maintaining productive therapeutic alli-

ances. McCullough has argued that the chronically de-
pressed patient is distinguished by preoperational thinking involving features such as egocentric views of the self
and others, impaired empathy, and lack of responsiveness to cor-
rective feedback. Although interpersonal difficulties such as social
skills deficits and interpersonal dependency are characteristic of
depressed patients in general  the
chronically depressed patient, according to McCullough, is unique
in his or her failure to understand the relationship between think-
ing, behavior, and environmental consequences. In turn, this re-
sults in a lack of effective agency, and a wariness of interpersonal
engagement  The interpersonal style of
the chronically depressed patient, according to McCullough, man-
ifests as either hostile detachment or excessive submissiveness. In
a test of McCullough?s theory, based on data gathered in several
samples using the Impact Message Inventory  Constantino et al. found that chronically depressed
patients, compared with an acutely depressed sample, had signif-
icantly greater hostile and lower friendly-dominant impacts on
their therapists. Compared with a normative comparison group,
chronically depressed patient impacts were significantly more hos-
tile and hostile-submissive, and significantly less friendly domi-
nant.
Our primary hypothesis was that a stronger early therapeutic
alliance would predict a significantly greater treatment response
both for patients receiving CBASP and for patients receiving BSP.
For CBASP, this hypothesis stemmed from previous findings
reported by Klein et al.  For BSP, the expectation of an
alliance?outcome association is consistent with the model?s puta-
tive focus on ?common factors,? including the therapeutic alliance
 As Markowitz et al. 
noted, although all psychotherapies use common factors, ?they . . .
do so to differing degrees?  Given BSP?s emphasis on the
therapeutic alliance and its de-emphasis of the procedural inter-
ventions characteristic of CBASP and other structured psychother-
apy models, we further hypothesized that the magnitude of the
alliance?outcome correlation would be greater in BSP than
CBASP. Additional aims were to explore whether CBASP and
BSP differed in alliance development and, if so, whether the two
models were associated with differences in the dimensions of early
alliance. On the basis of the findings of Strunk et al. and
DeRubeis and Feeley  we also aimed to evaluate the com-
plementary hypothesis that early symptom reduction would predict
therapeutic alliance rating across treatment.
Method
Design
The current study reports data from Phase 2 of the Research
Evaluating the Value of Augmenting Medication With Psychother-
apy trial. The REVAMP trial design has been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere  Briefly, it com-
prised two phases. In the nonrandomized Phase 1, all participants
received algorithm-driven antidepressant medication. Those who
did not achieve remission  a 24-item total HAM-D score of 7 or less, and not meeting
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth
edition, text revision criteria for MDD over two
consecutive visits during Weeks 6 through 12 continued to Phase
2, in which they were randomly assigned to receive CBASP 
antidepressant medication  BSP  ADM, or ADM only.
Phase 2 findings revealed no differences between the three condi-
tions in remission, partial response, or change in HAM-D scores.
Among all participants, remission was achieved in 15%, and
partial response in 22.5%  Secondary mixed
model analyses revealed significantly lower mean HAM-D scores
in the CBASP versus BSP comparison  although the two
groups did not differ in rate of change.
Participants
Participants were outpatients, age 18?75, recruited at eight
separate sites. Institutional Review Board committees at each site
approved the study. All patients met DSM?IV?TR criteria for current MDD as deter-
mined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM?IV Axis I
Disorders, Patient Edition  All patients had experienced the current MDD
episode for a minimum of 4 weeks, and all had experienced
depressive symptoms for at least 2 years without remission, thus
meeting criteria for chronic MDD, recurrent MDD with incom-
plete interepisode recovery, or ?double depression?  In addition, partici-
pants scored at least 20 on the 24-item HAM-D 
at baseline and spoke English.
Exclusion criteria were current diagnosis of any psychotic dis-
order; dementia; or antisocial, schizotypal, or severe borderline
personality disorder; current primary diagnosis of posttraumatic
stress disorder, anorexia, bulimia, or obsessive-compulsive disor-
der; history of bipolar disorder; previous CBASP treatment; pre-
vious nonresponse to four or more steps of pharmacotherapy
algorithm; unwillingness to terminate other psychiatric treatment
during the study; pregnancy; serious unstable medical illness; and
current alcohol or substance dependence that required detoxification. Participants with alcohol and
substance abuse were not excluded if they agreed to participate in
Alcoholics Anonymous or chemical dependence counseling and to
implement a sobriety plan while participating in the study.
Pharmacotherapy
All patients received concomitant algorithm-based pharmaco-
therapy. The pharmacotherapy algorithm was based on other empirically derived regimens
including the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve De-
pression study  The study medications included
sertraline, escitalopram, bupropion XL, venlafaxine XR, mirtazap-
ine, and lithium. Prior treatment history determined choice of
initial medication; treatment naïve patients began on sertraline.
Minimum and maximum doses, speed of dosage escalation, and
trial lengths after each change were specified by the protocol.
Participants were evaluated every 2 weeks. Participants who
were intolerant to a medication during the first 4 weeks of Phase
1 could move to the next option in the sequence. Pharmacothera-
pists followed the Fawcett, Epstein, Fiester, Elkin, and Autry
manual from the National Institute of Mental Health Treat-

ment of Depression Collaborative Research Program to ensure minimal psychotherapeutic
intervention.
CBASP
CBASP is a manualized, time-limited, cognitive-behavioral in-
tervention designed specifically for patients suffering from chronic
depression  A primary assumption of CBASP
is that chronically depressed patients fail to understand the rela-
tionships among their own thoughts, behaviors, and environmental
consequences. Situational analysis, a core CBASP procedure, is a
social problem-solving algorithm designed to modify maladaptive
thoughts and behaviors and enhance awareness of the conse-
quences of one?s own thoughts and behaviors  Patients are asked to track distressing inter-
personal situations between sessions using the Coping Style Ques-
tionnaire  During situational analysis, the
patient and therapist examine the associations among thoughts,
behaviors, and actual and desired outcomes in specific interper-
sonal encounters. CBASP focuses on examining discrepancies
between actual and desired outcomes and on how thinking and
behavior need to change in order to increase the likelihood of
achieving the desired outcome. If the desired outcome is unreal-
istic, the therapist works with the patient to formulate a more
achievable goal. CBASP therapists formulate transference hypoth-
eses at the beginning of treatment and implement explicit proce-
dures for addressing interactions within the therapeutic relation-
ship that are inconsistent with the patient?s relationship
expectations  with the goal of teaching the
patient the situational specificity of others? reactions to their be-
havior.
CBASP emphasizes the importance of ?disciplined personal
involvement? on the part of the psychother-
apist in promoting a sound therapeutic alliance. This requires the
therapist?s willingness to productively make use of both positive
and negative reactions to the patient. Positive reactions were often
contrasted with the responses of significant others in the patient?s
history. For instance, a therapist?s willingness to accept a patient?s
angry response might be contrasted with the habitual response of
significant others in the patient?s history  When the therapist has negative responses
toward a patient, procedures included verbalizing the response,
identifying the specific behavioral precipitant and its impact on the
therapist, and using the interaction to improve the patient?s under-
standing of his or her interpersonal impact on the therapist and on
others.
CBASP sessions occurred twice weekly during Weeks 1?4 and
once weekly during Weeks 5?12. During Weeks 5?8, up to four
additional sessions could be added if a participant needed addi-
tional assistance in mastering situational analysis. Thus, total
CBASP treatment ranged from 16 to 20 sessions.
BSP
BSP resembled client-centered therapy with
added psychoeducation regarding chronic depression. It was de-
signed to control for the nonspecific elements of psychotherapeutic
treatment and to provide a contrast with the more structured
CBASP  The model used in
the REVAMP study was similar to that used in studies of
depressed HIV-positive dysthymic
and chroni-
cally depressed alcohol abuse patients  Therapists conducting BSP used an
unpublished treatment manual that drew on the principles of sup-
portive psychotherapy and emphasized the following ?common? psychother-
apeutic factors  reflective listening,
empathic therapeutic responses, evoking affect, normalizing pa-
tient feelings such as anger and sadness, imparting therapeutic
hope, encouraging patients to find solutions rather than directly
suggesting them, and highlighting success experiences  Patients determined the session focus
and pace, making sessions much less structured than in CBASP.
Therapists elicited patients? emotional reactions and highlighted
patients? strengths. Specific interpersonal, cognitive, behavioral,
and psychodynamic interventions were prohibited  As in CBASP, 16?20 sessions of BSP
were scheduled over 12 weeks.
Forming an understanding and supportive therapeutic alliance is
a primary goal of BSP. Therapists sought to achieve this by letting
patients determine subject matter, listening carefully, mirroring
patient affects in their own emotional responses during a session
 echoing their feelings  using
therapeutic silence to allow feelings to build in the room to
demonstrate that therapists could tolerate ?noxious? patient feel-
ings, and providing support and encouragement. In short, the
alliance was fostered by helping the patient to feel that the thera-
pist understood and empathized with him or her 
Psychotherapists
All psychotherapists were licensed and had at least 2 years of
clinical experience after completing a doctorate degree in psychol-
ogy or a psychiatric residency, or at least 5 years of experience
after completing a master?s in social work degree. BSP therapists
were comparable to CBASP therapists in type of professional
degree and amount of clinical experience.
Supervision and Protocol Adherence
The developer of CBASP, James P. McCullough, Jr., PhD,
trained and certified CBASP therapists and site supervisors. Sim-
ilarly, John C. Markowitz, MD, trained and certified BSP thera-
pists and site supervisors. All psychotherapy sessions were video-
taped. Supervision was conducted by site supervisors who met
weekly with therapists. Drs. McCullough and Markowitz provided
monthly phone supervision to the full group of site CBASP and
BSP supervisors, respectively.
For both psychotherapy conditions, one or two session tapes for
each therapist?patient dyad were randomly selected and rated for
protocol adherence. Tapes were taken from early 
and/or late sessions and rated in their entirety
using the Collaborative Study Psychotherapy Rating Scale from

situational analysis  and the CBASP Therapist Adher-
ence Rating Scale 
Randomization
Randomization in Phase 2 was stratified by site, Phase 1 re-
sponse status  and medication
history  The randomization allocation ratio was 2:2:1
 Only the CBASP 
ADM and BSP  ADM treatment groups are included in the
current study.
Measures and Procedure
Depressive symptoms. Raters assessed participant depressive
symptoms every 2 weeks using the 24-item HAM-D  The 24-item version was selected because it contains cog-
nitive items characteristic of chronically depressed individuals.
Raters were blind to treatment condition. Rater and therapist
offices were physically separated at each site, and raters began
each assessment by requesting that participants not refer to psy-
chotherapy or psychotherapists during the interview.
Global Assessment of Functioning. Trained raters assessed
level of impairment due to psychiatric symptoms at baseline using
the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale  The GAF is a single numerical
rating designed to capture an individual?s psychological, social,
and occupational functioning. Scores range from 1 to 100, divided
into 10-point intervals, each with a set of distinguishing charac-
teristics. The GAF has demonstrated good interrater reliability
and correlated moderately with other general symp-
tom severity measures in a sample seeking outpatient mental
health treatment 
Therapeutic alliance. Because the current study focused on
the therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy, alliance data were not
collected in the medication-only group. For the CBASP and BSP
conditions, the patient-rated short form of the Working Alliance
Inventory was administered at three time points across Phase 2:
early  middle  and late 
Due to an administrative error, the WAI was not given at Week
2?41 of 224 participants in this study. In these instances,
the Week 4 score served as the early alliance score. Patients
providing alliance data at Week 2 did not statistically differ from
those providing data at Week 4 on any baseline or outcome
measure 
The WAI short form is a 12-item self-report measure derived
from the full 36-item WAI  It has
been widely used to assess therapeutic alliance. The full WAI
correlates moderately with other alliance measures  and scores on both the full form and short form have predicted psycho-
therapy outcome. We used the patient form because it predicts
psychotherapy outcome more strongly than psychotherapist-rated
assessment of the alliance  Because
participants had two treating clinicians, a pharmacotherapist and a
psychotherapist, the instructions clarified that the measure should
be completed specifically regarding their psychotherapists.
Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale with higher scores
reflecting a stronger therapeutic alliance. Both the original and the
shortened versions of the WAI have a purported two-level struc-
ture, with a general alliance factor that can be divided into three
subscale scores: Goals, designed to measure therapist and
patient agreement on the goals for therapy; Tasks, designed to
measure therapist and patient agreement on how to achieve treat-
ment goals; and Bond, designed to measure the quality of the
therapist?patient relationship 
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive data were calculated for the total sample and by
treatment group. Between-subjects descriptive variables were
compared using independent samples t tests for continuous data
and chi-square analyses for categorical data. Within-subjects de-
scriptive variables were compared using paired samples t tests.
Internal consistency of the WAI was examined by calculating
Cronbach?s alpha for the early, middle, and late WAI total scores.
A linear mixed model was used to test the main study hypothesis
that stronger early alliance would predict greater treatment re-
sponse. Fixed factors in the model included early WAI total score,
treatment group, the interaction of WAI total score with treatment
group, patient age, patient gender, baseline functioning  and
early change in HAM-D  For the 46 patients whose early alliance was
assessed at Week 4, the early change in symptoms variable was
calculated using Week 4 minus baseline HAM-D score. Early
change in HAM-D was included on the basis of the assumption
that early response to treatment could influence both early treat-
ment alliance and treatment outcome. Baseline GAF was included
on the assumption that initial severity may correlate with response
to treatment. GAF was chosen rather than baseline HAM-D be-
cause of potential multicollinearity with the change in early symp-
toms variable and because it incorporates a greater range of prog-
nostically relevant information  Continuous predictor variables were mean
centered, and dichotomous variables were coded as 0 or 1. The
dependent variable was HAM-D total score measured at Weeks 2,
4, 6, 8, and 12 of treatment  HAM-D observa-
tions were specified as a repeated measures variable based on time.
A similar linear mixed model was used to test whether early
HAM-D symptom reduction predicted subsequent alliance. This
model also tested whether CBASP  ADM and BSP  ADM
treatment groups differed in development of the alliance. Centered
values for early symptom change, treatment group, the interaction
of early symptom change with treatment group, GAF and patient
age, and dichotomous values for patient gender were entered as
fixed factors. The dependent variable was WAI total score at
Weeks 2  6, and 12. Mixed model analyses were conducted
using the MIXED procedure in SPSS. An alpha of .05 was used for
defining statistical significance in all analyses.
Effect size is reported as Cohen?s d. The Cohen?s d statistic can
be calculated from any statistical analysis that yields a t statistic

Results
Descriptive Characteristics
Sample demographics appear in Table 1. There were no statis-
tically significant differences between the two treatment groups on
baseline variables. Two hundred participants were randomized
to CBASP  ADM, and 195 were randomized to BSP  ADM.
Of these, data on the variables of interest were available for 111
participants in CBASP  ADM and 113 participants in BSP  ADM  Patients in the current study sample did

Mean HAM-D scores across treatment appear in Figure 1.
Consistent with findings of the main outcome study  HAM-D scores decreased in both groups during the 12-
week trial  Mean WAI scores, measured during the early
 middle  and late phases of the
study appear in Figure 2. WAI scores increased significantly
during the course of the study in both the BSP  ADM and
CBASP  ADM groups  Internal consistency of the WAI was
high at each time point 
Prediction of Symptom Outcome From Early
Therapeutic Working Alliance
The mixed model analysis testing the primary hypothesis
showed, as predicted, that higher early working alliance scores
were significantly associated with lower subsequent HAM-D
scores across treatment, F 62.48, p  .001. Parameter
estimates appear in Table 2. The Treatment Group   Alliance
interaction was also significant; however, the direction was con-
trary to prediction, indicating that the association between alliance
and subsequent symptom reduction was stronger among those in
CBASP  ADM when compared with those in BSP  ADM, F 8.31, p  .004. Greater reduction in HAM-D scores in the
initial weeks of treatment significantly predicted lower subsequent
HAM-D scores, F 40.57, p  .001, as did higher
baseline level of functioning as measured by the GAF,
F 84.85, p  .001, and CBASP treatment group, F 4.19, p  .04, although treatment groups did not signif-
icantly differ at the study end point. Age and gender were not
predictive of HAM-D symptom reduction.
In order to further assess the finding that the association be-
tween alliance and HAM-D symptom reduction was stronger in
CBASP  ADM than in BSP  ADM, additional mixed models
analyses were run separately for each treatment group. The models
were similar to the main analysis except that treatment group and
the interaction of early alliance rating with treatment group were
removed as fixed factors. As in the combined model, significant
predictors for both treatment groups were baseline GAF, early
alliance, and early HAM-D symptom change. In addition, there
was a trend for younger age to predict greater HAM-D symptom
reduction in BSP  ADM, F 3.72, p  .05. Parameter
estimates appear in Tables 3a and 3b. Among those in CBASP 
ADM, the estimated effect of early working alliance on HAM-D
symptom reduction across treatment was .22 compared with
.11 in BSP  ADM. Thus, over the course of treatment, those in
CBASP  ADM showed an average HAM-D-point decrease of
1.32 for each additional point increase on the WAI, whereas those
in BSP  ADM showed an average HAM-D decrease of .66 for
each additional point increase on the WAI. Cohen?s d for early
working alliance was 1.00 in CBASP  ADM compared with .48
in BSP  ADM.
Prediction of Therapeutic Working Alliance From
Early Symptom Reduction
In the mixed model analysis evaluating whether treatment
group or early symptom reduction predicted average alliance
over treatment, early change in HAM-D did not predict mean
therapeutic alliance ratings across treatment as a main effect,
F 1.48, p  .23, or interact with treatment group to
predict alliance, F 0.02, p  .90. Treatment group
was predictive of therapeutic alliance such that mean alliance
ratings across treatment were higher among those in CBASP 
ADM when compared with those in BSP  ADM, F
4.10, p  .04. Parameter estimates indicated that, on average,
those in CBASP  ADM showed mean alliance ratings that

Treatment Group Differences in Therapeutic Working
Alliance Ratings
In order to explore treatment group differences in the
alliance? outcome relationship, bivariate Pearson correlations
between early alliance and HAM-D total scores at all time
points were computed for each treatment group. Correlations
appear in Table 4. Among patients who received CBASP 
ADM, early alliance accounted for 4.4%?12.3% of the total
variance in depressive symptoms between Weeks 4 and 12.
Among patients receiving BSP  ADM, early alliance was not
significantly correlated with symptom ratings except at Week 6,
where it explained 5.3% of the variance in depressive symptom
on the HAM-D.
An additional exploratory analysis was conducted to identify
whether particular aspects of the alliance differed between the

Discussion
We examined the association between early psychotherapeutic
alliance and subsequent symptom change across treatment in a
large sample of chronically depressed patients receiving two dif-
ferent psychotherapy models, CBASP or BSP, combined with
ADM. We also tested an alternative explanation for the relation-
ship between the alliance and outcome, namely that early symptom
change predicts subsequent alliance. Additionally, we tested
whether patients in these two treatments differed in alliance de-
velopment and in dimensions of the alliance early in treatment.
Consistent with the primary hypothesis, in both the CBASP 
ADM and BSP  ADM conditions, early alliance significantly
predicted subsequent depressive symptom ratings. Furthermore,
we observed these relationships after accounting for the variance
in outcome associated with baseline functioning and symptom
change occurring prior to the alliance assessment. Our findings on
the alliance?outcome association in CBASP replicate those of
Klein et al.  who found that alliance predicted subsequent
depressive symptoms, controlling for change prior to alliance
assessment among chronically depressed patients receiving
CBASP  ADM as well among patients receiving only CBASP.
We know of no findings testing the relationship between alliance
and outcome in patients receiving BSP, alone or with antidepres-
sant but our findings appear consistent with the conceptualiza-
tion of BSP as a ?common factors? treatment emphasizing features that are shared across dif-
ferent models of psychotherapy, including the therapeutic alliance.
In the combined mixed model involving the full study sample,
early alliance, baseline GAF, treatment arm, early change in de-
pressive symptoms, and the interaction of treatment arm with early
alliance all significantly predicted outcome. In the models in which
these variables were evaluated separately for patients randomized
to BSP  ADM and CBASP  ADM, early symptom change,
early alliance, and GAF continued to predict in both conditions.
Although we had hypothesized that the alliance would predict
outcome in both BSP and CBASP, the role of the therapeutic
alliance presumably functions differently in these two models. In
contrasting the alliance in CBT-oriented therapies with other mod-
els, Castonguay, Constantino, McAleavey, and Goldfried 
noted that CBT models rely on specific techniques that produce
change ?on their own?  whereas other psychotherapy
models may conceptualize the alliance as ?a change mechanism

itself?  That the alliance predicted outcome in both of
these models provides evidence of its critical role across different
approaches to psychotherapy.
We hypothesized that the magnitude of the alliance?outcome
association would be greater in the BSP than the CBASP group.
This hypothesis was not supported. In fact, although we did find a
significant Alliance   Treatment interaction, the association be-
tween the alliance and HAM-D ratings was significantly higher
among patients receiving CBASP compared with BSP. We also
found evidence that participants in the CBASP condition rated
alliance as stronger across treatment than those in BSP.
Because BSP is conceptualized as a ?common factors? treat-
ment emphasizing features
that are shared across different models of psychotherapy, including
the therapeutic alliance, we were surprised by both of these find-
ings. In examining WAI subscale scores of early alliance ratings,
we found no differences between BSP and CBASP groups on the
Bond subscale. However, CBASP patients rated the Tasks and
Goals subscale items more highly than those in the BSP condition.
One explanation for these findings is that compared with those in
the nondirective BSP, the structural features of CBASP enhanced the patients? sense
that the treatment procedures would be helpful and that their goals
for treatment were aligned with those of their therapists. In gen-
eral, the task and goal dimensions of the therapeutic alliance may
be amplified in a structured treatment emphasizing specific pro-
cedures, compared with a less structured one. Our findings are
consistent with those of Webb et al., 2011, who reported that the
relationship between the WAI and depression
symptom reduction in CT was significantly related to a factor
comprising patient?therapist agreement on goals and tasks, but not
to a factor assessing affective bond between patient and therapist.
The possibility that clear within-session procedures may pro-
mote a stronger therapeutic alliance when compared with the
nondirective therapies was discussed almost two decades ago
and is consistent with two subsequent
studies, which found higher alliance levels in CBT than
psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy  Bedi, Davis, and
Williams found that from the patient perspective, tech-
niques addressing symptoms were more important in facilitating
the therapeutic alliance than actions specifically aimed at alliance
development. More frequent alliance
measures would help to determine whether the pattern of differ-
ences in the alliance that we observed across the two treatments
would replicate.
Interestingly, and consistent with others? findings  alliance scores significantly increased in linear fashion over
the 12-week treatment in both groups. We found no evidence of a
V-shaped pattern, reflecting a strong early alliance, followed by
rupture and repair, which has been found in some studies to be
associated with superior outcome  However, we only assessed the alliance at three time points,
and we cannot rule out the possibility that more frequent assess-
ment might have revealed such a pattern. Although alliances
improved over the course of treatment, symptom change prior to
assessment of the early alliance did not predict subsequent alliance
ratings, suggesting that alliance ratings were not attributable to
early symptom change. Even so, patients? experience of the ther-
apeutic alliance may be strengthened by improvement in depres-
sion across later stages of treatment, by increased familiarity and

635THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE AND TREATMENT OUTCOME
contact with the therapist, or both. Both the total scores and the
change observed over the course of treatment are similar to those
reported by Klein et al. in a previous investigation of the
alliance?outcome relationship in chronically depressed patients
using the WAI short form.
Little attention has been paid to the relative size of alliance
effects in predicting outcome across studies. We found Cohen?s
d?s of 1.00 for CBASP  ADM and 0.48 for BSP  ADM. Effect
sizes can also be presented as an r statistic. Crits-Christoph and
colleagues recently demonstrated that effects of alliance on
treatment outcome are consistently larger when aggregated across
multiple observations. These authors found r values of .32, .38,
and .41 when predicting outcome in psychotherapy for depression
from alliance scores aggregated across Sessions 3?6, 4?7, and
5?8, respectively. While Crits-Cristoph et al. assessed
alliance across multiple treatment modalities, Gaston et al. 
isolated independent effects of alliance on outcome in behavior
therapy, cognitive therapy, and brief psychodynamic therapy.
These authors reported rs between early treatment alliance and
outcome of .56, .48, and .42 across the three modalities, respec-
tively. Translating to r values, we found effects of alliance on
outcome of .58 and .32 in CBASP and BSP. Thus, our findings are
consistent with previously published work.
Given that alliance scores increased as HAM-D scores de-
creased, we examined whether early symptom change predicted
alliance ratings over the course of treatment and did not find a
relationship. This finding is consistent with those of Klein et al.
 Barber et al.  and Feeley et al.  but not with
two other studies 
Differences between our findings and those of Strunk et al. 
may reflect considerable differences in analytic strategies. We
examined the relationship between early change and later alliance,
whereas Strunk et al. focused on only the first five
therapist?patient encounters. Among other differences, our sample
consisted entirely of chronically depressed patients, and all of our
participants received concomitant pharmacotherapy. That early
alliance predicted subsequent symptom ratings yet early symptom
change did not predict later alliance suggests that the observed
increases in alliance across the study are not merely a consequence
of patients? decreased depression. The patient?s perception of their
relationship with their therapist does not appear to be attributable
to improved mood.
Our study had several limitations that may limit generalizability.
First, all patients received psychotherapy in the context of a
randomized clinical trial with several unique characteristics. They
were initially recruited for an open pharmacotherapy trial from
which only partial or nonresponders to medication were random-
ized to BSP  ADM or CBASP  ADM. Thus, patients may have
been somewhat more discouraged compared with those participat-
ing in trials that do not select for non- or partial response. In
addition, many of these patients may not have been initially
seeking psychotherapy, or, conversely, were seeking psychother-
apy and had to wait to receive it. Second, both BSP and CBASP
were limited to 12 weeks. Third, all patients received concomitant
pharmacotherapy; the extent to which these findings apply to
settings in which psychotherapy is provided alone is unclear. Klein
et al. found that, among chronically depressed patients
receiving CBASP alone or CBASP combined with pharmacother-
apy, alliances were stronger in the combined condition, but the
relationship between the alliance and outcome was similar in both
conditions  Additionally, the extent of coop-
eration, collegiality, supervision, and accountability among psy-
chopharmacologists and psychotherapists under clinical trial con-
ditions may differ from community settings. Fourth, some study
patients were omitted due to missing data. The current sample
comprises approximately 57% of the total number of patients
randomized to the two psychotherapy arms of the study  Although we observed no differences between patients
whom we included versus those who lacked alliance data, we
cannot rule out differences beyond those that were formally as-
sessed. Finally, because there were no significant differences in the
primary efficacy measures between the three treatment groups
 it could be argued that the significant reduc-
tions in depression observed in all three conditions were attribut-
able to the effects of medication. However, we assume that
between-group and within-group change are independent. That is,
even when mean levels of between-group change are similar, the
predictors of change and their magnitude of effects may differ in
each group. Conversely, it is possible that levels of change may be
significantly different between groups, and yet within-group pre-
dictors of change may be similar. Moreover, the working alliance
was not assessed in patients receiving medication only, and thus
we can neither rule out nor support the possibility that it was a
significant predictor of the changes observed in that group.
The above limitations notwithstanding, our study had numerous
strengths. These include the randomized design, adequate sample
size for testing the study hypotheses, ability to compare the ther-
apeutic alliance?outcome relationship in two psychotherapies with
different assumptions regarding the role of the alliance, careful
assessment of patients, use of blinded raters, and use of experi-
enced therapists.
To conclude, we found that alliance quality significantly pre-
dicted subsequent change in depressive symptoms among patients
receiving CBASP and BSP  The strength of
the relationship between the alliance and outcome was signifi-
cantly greater in CBASP, a more structured psychotherapy com-
pared with BSP. Nonetheless, that early therapeutic alliance sig-
nificantly predicted subsequent symptom ratings in two dissimilar
psychotherapy models after accounting for early improvement in
symptoms underscores its consistent and important role in the
process of change.
